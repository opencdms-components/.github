The `opencdms-components` organization on GitHub contains trusted third-party open-source components that have been developed for OpenCDMS.

These components are not necessary fully audited for correctness/security. However, they are developed by trusted collaborators with oversight from the OpenCDMS developer team.

OpenCDMS Components are usually developed using the "OpenCDMS Component cookie cutter". See additional documentation in the [component-cookiecutter](https://github.com/opencdms/component-cookiecutter) repository.
